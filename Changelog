dizzy ? - ?

    * use fragment shaders (if available) to make texture blending less
      laggy (esp. with higher texture resolutions)
    * use fragment shaders (if available) instead of the CPU to render
      textures, allowing for very fast rendering of high-resolution textures
    * removed all GLSL versions of textures - GLSL rendering is now done
      by automatically converting the Perl code to GLSL and running that
    * implement a texture cache to speed up startup times
    * added a -z/--zoom option, acting like the slider in windizz
    * removed -s option in favor of -z
    * new textures
