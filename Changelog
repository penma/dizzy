dizzy ? - ?

    * use fragment shaders (if available) to make texture blending less
      laggy (esp. with higher texture resolutions)
    * use fragment shaders (if available) instead of the CPU to render
      textures, allowing for very fast rendering of high-resolution textures
    * removed all Perl versions of textures - CPU rendering is now done
      by automatically converting the GLSL code to Perl and running that
