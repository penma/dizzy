* Properties of the function itself

Dizzy textures are defined as a mathematical function that returns a
brightness value for every pixel of the texture. Or in other words:
the function maps (x,y) to v.

The function is given two parameters which are the x and y coordinates.
The function has to return the brightness value.

The x and y values are of the 'double' type and range from -0.5 to 0.5
each. The return value is of the 'double' type as well, ranging from
0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white).

* How to tell dizzy about the function

To register the function, add a new file in the textures/ directory.
The name is irrelevant (for now. In the future, it might be displayed to the
user to indicate the active texture, so use numbers or an intelligent name).

In this new file, put:

	TEXFUNC {
		/* your code */
		return the_value;
	}

TEXFUNC is a macro that expands to a proper function prototype. If you really
care, read the source of maketextures and you know why you want to live with
it.

* Available variables

The function is given the named parameters x and y, denoting the position in
the texture. They range from -0.5 to 0.5.

There are some macros defined for common calculations:

angle  - the angle of the pixel relative to the center. A very small value for
         the center itself.
dist   - the distance of the pixel to the center. Is positive and can obviously
         not be larger than +sqrt(0.5).

* Writing more complex functions

Some functions might need helper functions. To ensure that no name conflicts
arise you should use the AUXFUNC macro to generate an unique name.

All helper functions should be (although needn't be) declared static.

	static double AUXFUNC(dotproduct)(double x, double y) {
		/* ... */
	}
	
	TEXFUNC {
		return AUXFUNC(dotproduct)(x, y);
	}
