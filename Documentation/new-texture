How to add a new texture to dizzy

* Properties of the function itself

A Dizzy texture is defined as a mathematical function that returns a brightness
value for every pixel of the texture.  In other words, the function maps (x,y)
to v.

The function is given two parameters which are the x and y coordinates.  They
are values of the 'double' type and are in the range from -0.5 to 0.5 each.
The return value is of the 'double' type as well, ranging from 0.0 (black) to
1.0 (white.)

* How to tell dizzy about the function

To register the function, add a new file in the textures/ directory.  The name
is irrelevant (for now.  In the future, it might be displayed to the user to
indicate the active texture, so use numbers or an intelligent name.)

In the new file, put:

	TEXFUNC {
		/* Your code */
		return the_value;
	}

TEXFUNC is a macro that expands to a proper function prototype.  If you wish to
know more, read the source of maketextures.

* Available variables

There are some macros defined for common calculations:

angle - the angle of the pixel relative to the center.  A very small value for
        the center itself.
dist  - the distance of the pixel to the center.  Is positive and can obviously
        not be larger than +sqrt(0.5).

* Writing more complex functions

Some texture functions might need helper functions.  To ensure that no name
conflicts arise you should use the AUXFUNC macro to generate an unique name,
like this:

	static double AUXFUNC(dotproduct)(double x, double y) {
		/* ... */
	}

	TEXFUNC {
		return AUXFUNC(dotproduct)(x, y);
	}

All helper functions should (although needn't) be declared static.
